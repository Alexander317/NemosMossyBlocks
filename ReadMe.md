# Nemo's Mossy Blocks

As the name suggests, this mod brings moss to more blocks!

I love to create mods for Minecraft and wish to live off it one day, so I hope you like what I do.
Either way feel free to give me your feedback and suggestions, either in the comments or on my [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/yxs9dga) :)
